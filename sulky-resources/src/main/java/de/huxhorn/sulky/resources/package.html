This package contains classes that provide "object-oriented" locale specific resource resolution.

<h2 id="java">Ordinary resource resolution in Java</h2>
This section describes different ways of resource resolution provided by Java&trade;.

<h3 id="files">Loading resources from files</h3>

<p>Loading resources from files is generally a bad idea. Files are always
    either relative to the current directory of the application or absolute and
    therefore platform-dependant. If the application is expected to work on
    any operating system without a change the use of <code>File</code> <strong>for resources</strong>
    should be avoided.</p>
<dl>
    <dt><code>public File(String pathname)</code></dt>
    <dd>
        The given <code>pathname</code> is resolved <strong>relative to the current application directory</strong> if
        it's not an absolute path already.<br/>
        If this constructor is used to obtain resources it obviously won't be possible to do
        tasks in your application that depend on the current application directory (e.g. 'dir')
        because the user is required to change the current directory to the install directory
        of the application before starting it. Otherwise it wouldn't be able to find it's
        required resources.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>public File(String parent, String child)</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Usage of this constructor isn't as bad as the previous one because it's platform independant
        if <code>parent</code> was obtained in a platform independant way e.g. by calling
        <code>System.getProperty(String)</code> with argument <code>"java.io.tmpdir"</code>
        for temporary files or <code>"user.home"</code> for application settings.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="classloader">Obtaining resources using <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code>
    or <code>java.lang.Class</code></h3>

<p>By using the methods <code>getResource</code> and <code>getResourceAsStream</code> of
    <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> or <code>java.lang.Class</code> the resource locations are
    at least platform independant. They can (and should) be contained in JAR files which translates
    into faster resolution and less disk space usage.</p>

<p>Resources obtained by the <code>ClassLoader</code> (directly or
    indirectly by <code>Class</code>) are never locale specific like
    <code>ResourceBundle</code>-resources (explained <a href="#resourceBundle">below</a>).</p>

<p>A (quite unobvious) drawback of <code>Class.getResource</code> is that the apparent
    usage results in an inheritance unsafe class under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>This is probably best explained by an example:</p>
<code><pre>
package foobar;

public class Foo
{
    public void someMethod()
    {
        [..]
        URL resourceUrl = getClass().getResource("myResource.png");
        [..]
    }
}
</pre>
</code>

<p>Looks quite right, doesn't it? Well, it isn't. Instead it contains a major bug!</p>

<p>Because <code>Foo</code> is <code>public</code> and not <code>final</code> it's possible
    to extend it.</p>
<code><pre>
package your.customer;

public class MyFoo extends foobar.Foo
{
    public void anotherMethod()
    {
        [..]
        someMethod();
        [..]
    }
}
</pre>
</code>

<p>If your customer calls <code>someMethod()</code> the class <code>MyFoo</code> won't
    be able to find the resource because it is searched for <strong>relative to the
        package <code>your.customer</code></strong> (<code>getClass()</code> in <code>someMethod()</code>
    will, correctly but very unlikely expected, return
    <code>your.customer.MyFoo.class</code> instead of <code>foobar.Foo.class</code>).</p>

<p>The correct way to implement class <code>Foo</code> in an inheritance safe manner
    would look like this:</p>
<code><pre>
package foobar;

public class Foo
{
    public void someMethod()
    {
        [..]
        URL resourceUrl = <strong>Foo.class</strong>.getResource("myResource.png");
        [..]
    }
}
</pre>
</code>

<p>That way <code>someMethod()</code> will still search relative to the package <code>foobar</code> even
    if called on an extending class in a different package.</p>

<h3 id="resourceBundle">Obtaining locale specific resources using <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code></h3>

<p>
</p>

<h2 id="ooresources">"Object-oriented" locale specific resource resolution</h2>

<p>The obvious solution.
</p>

<h3>Class local resources</h3>
Instead of resolving a resource relative to the package
of the current class it should be resolved relative to the class itself.
